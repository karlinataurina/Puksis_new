                        sleeping!
                        I like food too. My favorite food is grilled turkey or sometimes I steal blueberries or
                        strawberries
                        from my
                        mom, I know I'm not supposed to eat them, but I <i>reeeaally</i> like them!
                        I sometimes get bored, so to get rid of boredom I find new and exciting things to do and
                        explore!
                        <br>One time I found a paper bag full of stuff. It looked interesting so I put my head in it to
                        smell
                        it. I immediately felt something on my neck so I panicked and started running around the house
                        to
                        get rid of the
                        thing, but it was chasing me! Good thing mom was chasing the thing and got rid of it!
                        Turns out it was a trash bag and the thing around my neck was bag handle. Anyway, it was
                        <i>super
                            scary</i>
                        at the time!
